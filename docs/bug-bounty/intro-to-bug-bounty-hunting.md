# Intro to Bug Bounty Hunting
A beginner-friendly guide to understanding bug bounty hunting, platforms, rewards, and best practices.

## What is a Bug?
A **bug** is an error, flaw, or vulnerability in software that may lead to unintended behavior. Some bugs cause minor issues, while others create security risks, making them valuable targets for bug bounty hunters.

## What is Bug Bounty Hunting?
Bug bounty hunting is the practice of **finding and reporting security vulnerabilities** in exchange for rewards. Organizations offer **bug bounty programs** to improve security by allowing ethical hackers to test their systems.

## How Do Bug Bounties Work?
1. Companies define **a scope** (what can be tested).
2. Bug bounty hunters search for **security flaws** within the allowed scope.
3. If a valid vulnerability is found, it's reported to the company.
4. The company reviews the report and provides **rewards** based on severity.

## Bug Bounty Rewards (üí∞ Payouts)
- **Cash rewards** (based on severity: Low, Medium, High, Critical).
- **Hall of Fame recognition** (your name on a public leaderboard).
- **Swag & goodies** (t-shirts, stickers, and premium tool access).
- **Job opportunities** (many companies recruit skilled bounty hunters!).
