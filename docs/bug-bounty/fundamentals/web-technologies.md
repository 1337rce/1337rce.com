Web Technologies: Unmusking the Building Blocks of Web Applications


It is important to understand the underlying web technologies used by a target application, as it is a critical first step in bug bounty hunting. Knowing the server-side languages, frameworks, databases, and client-side libraries can help you identify common vulnerabilities associated with those specific technologies, narrowing down your attack surface.

## Why Identify Web Technologies?

**Vulnerability Research**: Specific technologies often have known vulnerabilities (CVEs) or common misconfigurations.  

**Attack Vector Prioritization**: Certain technologies are more prone to particular types of attacks (e.g., SQL injection with specific database types, XSS with certain JavaScript frameworks).  

**Reconnaissance**: It provides valuable clues about the application's architecture and potential weak points.  


## Identifying Web Technologies

Here are some popular and effective resources for identifying the technologies a website uses:

### BuiltWith.com
A comprehensive website profiler that provides detailed information about what technologies a website is built with, including analytics, frameworks, advertising, CDNs, and more. It offers a broad overview from a single URL.  

**Usage**: Simply enter the website's URL into the search bar on `https://builtwith.com/`.

### Wappalyzer - Browser Extension
A cross-platform utility that uncovers the technologies used on websites. It detects content management systems, e-commerce platforms, web servers, JavaScript frameworks, analytics tools, and many other web technologies directly from your browser.  

**Usage**: Install the Wappalyzer extension (available for Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.). Navigate to any website, and click the Wappalyzer icon in your browser toolbar to see a list of detected technologies.  

### Kali Linux built-in Tool: `whatweb`
`whatweb` is an open-source web scanner that identifies web technologies, including content management systems (CMS), blogging platforms, JavaScript libraries, web servers, and much more. It also provides version numbers where possible.  

**Usage**: Run `whatweb` from your Kali Linux terminal, specifying the full URL of the target.  

**Example Command**:
        ```bash
        whatweb https://example.com
        ```
        **Note**: Always include `https://` (or `http://`) to specify the protocol correctly.
