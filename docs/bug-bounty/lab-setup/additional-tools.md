Additional Tools for Bug Bounty Hunting 

### Additional Tools for Bug Bounty Hunting

Except the fundamental setup of a VM and Burp Suite, a bug bounty hunter's toolkit is constantly evolving. These tools enhance various stages of the bug hunting process, from reconnaissance to exploitation.

---
### 1. Proxies & Interceptors (Beyond Burp Suite)

*   **OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy)**: An open-source web application security scanner that provides a range of features for vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, and web scraping. It's often considered a free alternative to Burp Suite, especially for beginners.
*   **Caido**: Another popular intercepting proxy that allows you to see and modify HTTP/HTTPS communications.

### 2. Reconnaissance Tools

Reconnaissance is the crucial first phase, where you gather as much information as possible about your target to expand your attack surface.

#### a. Subdomain Enumeration
These tools help discover subdomains associated with a target domain, often revealing hidden or less-protected assets.

*   **Subfinder**: A fast and versatile subdomain discovery tool from ProjectDiscovery that collects subdomains from multiple sources and supports passive and active enumeration.
*   **Amass**: An in-depth attack surface mapping and asset discovery tool that uses various techniques for comprehensive subdomain and asset enumeration.
*   **Assetfinder**: Finds domains and subdomains from a range of sources.
*   **Findomain**: Known for its speed, this cross-platform tool quickly enumerates subdomains.
*   **crt.sh**: A certificate transparency log search engine that can reveal subdomains from SSL/TLS certificates.
*   **Sudomy**: An automated reconnaissance tool focused on subdomain enumeration and analysis for bug hunting and penetration testing.

#### b. Content Discovery (Directories & Files)
Tools for finding hidden directories, files, and endpoints on a web server.

*   **FFUF (Fuzz Faster U Fool)**: A fast web fuzzer that can be used for directory and file brute-forcing, virtual host fuzzing, and parameter discovery.
*   **Dirsearch**: A powerful command-line tool designed to brute-force directories and files on web servers.
*   **Gobuster**: A brute-force tool for web enumeration, including directories, files, and DNS subdomains.
*   **Katana**: A fast web crawler that excels at discovering unlinked endpoints, even in JavaScript-heavy applications.
*   **Waybackurls / GAU (GetAllUrls)**: Tools that fetch URLs, links, and other indexed files from the Wayback Machine (Internet Archive) and other archiving engines, often revealing historical endpoints.
*   **ParamSpider**: Extracts hidden and unlinked parameters from JavaScript files and web archives, crucial for finding vulnerabilities like IDOR, XSS, and SQLi.

#### c. Port Scanning
For identifying open ports and services running on a target's network.

*   **Nmap**: The classic network mapper, widely used for discovering hosts, services, and open ports on a network.
*   **Naabu**: A fast port scanner developed in Go, focusing on reliability and simplicity.
*   **Masscan**: A high-performance TCP port scanner capable of scanning the entire internet rapidly.

#### d. JavaScript Analysis
JavaScript files are often a goldmine for sensitive information like API keys, hidden endpoints, and client-side vulnerabilities.

*   **LinkFinder**: A simple yet effective tool for finding links, URLs, and other referenced files and endpoints within JavaScript code.
*   **SubJS / GetJS**: Fetches JavaScript files from a list of URLs or subdomains for further analysis.
*   **JSleak / JSecret**: Command-line tools designed to uncover secrets and links in JavaScript files.
*   **MapperPlus**: An advanced JavaScript analysis tool for in-depth static and dynamic analysis, offering insights into vulnerabilities and hidden endpoints.

#### e. OSINT (Open Source Intelligence)
Gathering information from publicly available sources to understand a target's digital footprint.

*   **theHarvester**: A tool for gathering open-source intelligence about a target, including emails, subdomains, hosts, employee names, open ports, and banners.
*   **Shodan / Censys**: Search engines for internet-connected devices that can reveal exposed servers, services, and misconfigured assets.
*   **Google Dorking**: Using advanced search operators in Google (and other search engines) to find specific information, including subdomains and sensitive files.
*   **Git tools (e.g., Gitrob, Gitjacker, shhgit)**: For searching public GitHub repositories for sensitive information, credentials, and exposed `.git` directories.

### 3. Vulnerability Scanners & Fuzzers

Tools that automate the detection of common vulnerabilities or help test input handling.

*   **Nuclei**: A fast and configurable vulnerability scanner based on YAML-based templates, making it highly efficient for targeted scanning.
*   **SQLmap**: An automated SQL injection tool that detects and exploits SQL injection flaws in web applications.
*   **XSStrike**: Considered one of the most advanced XSS scanners, it helps detect various Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities.
*   **Dalfox**: A powerful open-source XSS scanner and utility focused on automation.
*   **CRLFuzz**: A tool specifically designed to scan for CRLF injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Xray**: A powerful next-gen vulnerability scanner capable of detecting SQLi, XSS, SSRF, and more.

### 4. Exploitation Tools

Once a vulnerability is identified, these tools can help confirm and sometimes exploit them.

*   **Metasploit Framework**: A widely used penetration testing framework that provides a collection of exploits and payloads for various systems and applications.
*   **Commix**: An automated all-in-one OS command injection exploitation tool.

### 5. API Testing Tools

For targets heavily reliant on APIs, specialized tools are essential.

*   **Postman**: A popular API client for developing, testing, and controlling API requests. It's excellent for crafting and observing API interactions.
*   **GraphQLmap / Clairvoyance**: Tools specifically designed for testing GraphQL endpoints, helping to map API structures and identify vulnerabilities even when introspection is disabled.
*   **NoSQLMap**: An automated NoSQL database enumeration and web application exploitation tool, useful when dealing with NoSQL databases behind APIs.
*   **JWT_Tool**: A toolkit for testing, tweaking, and cracking JSON Web Tokens, critical for applications using JWTs for authentication.
